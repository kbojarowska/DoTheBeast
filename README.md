# DoTheBeast
Welcome to Do The Beast! This application is your gateway to managing tasks and to-do lists in a gamified DND style, where tasks are quests and monsters await your challenge.

## Overview
Do The Beast merges task management with the excitement of Dungeons and Dragons. Create to-do lists, prioritize tasks, and engage in battles with monsters associated with your tasks. As you conquer your tasks, you'll conquer these monsters, collecting trophies and enhancing your productivity.

### Features
- **Multiple To-Do Lists**: Organize your tasks into separate lists for various aspects of your life or projects.
- **Task Prioritization**: Assign priorities to tasks, determining the strength of the associated monster.
- **Monster Battles**: Combat monsters as you complete tasks, deducting HP based on task priorities.
- **Monster Trophies**: Claim trophies upon defeating monsters, showcasing your productivity.
- **Friendlists and Shared Lists**: Collaborate with friends by sharing lists and embarking on quests together.

## How It Works
### Task Creation and Prioritization
- **Creating Lists**: Begin by establishing multiple to-do lists for different categories or projects.
- **Adding Tasks**: Populate your lists with tasks and assign their priorities.
- **Priority System**: The higher the task priority, the more formidable the associated monster.

### Monster Battles
- **Task Completion**: As tasks are accomplished, engage in battles with the associated monsters.
